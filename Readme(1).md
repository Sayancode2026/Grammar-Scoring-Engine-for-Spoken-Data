🌐 Project Overview
A fast and reliable search function is essential for a positive user experience on any e-commerce site. This project analyzes two fundamental search algorithms—Linear Search and Binary Search—to illustrate the importance of algorithmic efficiency. It serves as a practical guide to understanding why choosing the right algorithm is critical for application performance and scalability.

💡 Core Concepts Explained
Asymptotic Notation (Big O)
Big O notation is used to describe an algorithm's performance as the input data size (n) grows. It provides a high-level understanding of scalability by focusing on the worst-case scenario.

O(n) - Linear Time: Execution time grows linearly with the number of items. Doubling the data doubles the time.
O(log n) - Logarithmic Time: Execution time grows by a very small amount as data doubles. This is the hallmark of highly efficient, scalable algorithms.
🏗️ Project Structure
The project is organized using a standard package-based structure to ensure clean separation of concerns.

🚀 How to Compile and Run
Follow these instructions to compile and run the project from your command line.

[!IMPORTANT]
All commands must be executed from the src directory. This is the root of the package structure and is required for javac to resolve the package paths correctly.

&lt;details>
&lt;summary>&lt;strong>Windows Instructions (Command Prompt / PowerShell)&lt;/strong>&lt;/summary>

Open your terminal and navigate to this project's src directory.

PowerShell

# Example: cd C:\path\to\your\project\ECommerceSearchOptimization\src
cd \path\to\your\project\ECommerceSearchOptimization\src
Compile all .java source files. The javac command compiles all listed files, resolving dependencies between them.

PowerShell

javac com\ecommerce\model\Product.java com\ecommerce\search\SearchAlgorithm.java com\ecommerce\Main.java
Run the application. Use the java command with the fully qualified name of the main class (package.ClassName).

PowerShell

java com.ecommerce.Main
&lt;/details>

Open your terminal and navigate to this project's src directory.

Bash

# Example: cd /Users/YourUser/projects/ECommerceSearchOptimization/src
cd /path/to/your/project/ECommerceSearchOptimization/src
Compile all .java source files. The javac command compiles all listed files, resolving dependencies between them.

Bash

javac com/ecommerce/model/Product.java com/ecommerce/search/SearchAlgorithm.java com/ecommerce/Main.java
Run the application. Use the java command with the fully qualified name of the main class (package.ClassName).

📊 Analysis and Recommendation
Metric	Linear Search	Binary Search
Time Complexity	O(n)	O(
logn)
Data Prerequisite	Unsorted or Sorted	Must be Sorted
Scalability	Poor	Excellent

Export to Sheets
Recommendation: For any production e-commerce platform, Binary Search (and the principles behind it) is the only viable option. The performance degradation of Linear Search with large catalogs leads to poor user experience. The initial cost of sorting the data (O(n
logn)) is a necessary trade-off for achieving near-instantaneous search times.

In a real-world scenario, this logic is implemented using database indexes (B-Trees) or dedicated search engines like Elasticsearch, which are built on these efficient principles.

✅ Expected Output
A successful run will produce the following output, demonstrating the successful execution of both searches. (Note: timing values will vary).

Plaintext

### Linear Search Demonstration ###
Result: Product[ID=P004, Name=Book, Category=Books]
Linear Search took: 702500 ns
-------------------------------------

### Binary Search Demonstration ###
Array has been sorted by productId for binary search.

Result: Product[ID=P004, Name=Book, Category=Books]
Binary Search took: 16800 ns
-------------------------------------
